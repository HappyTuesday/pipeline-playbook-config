#   EXAMPLE:

############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/kafka/data

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions={{PARTITIONS}}

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.

############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################
# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics "__consumer_offsets" and "__transaction_state"
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended for to ensure availability such as 3.

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to exceessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
log.flush.interval.messages={{ LOG_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MESSAGES }}

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms={{ LOG_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS }}

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours={{LOG_RETENTION_HOURS}}

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
log.retention.bytes={{LOG_RETENTION_BYTES}}

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect={{ZOOKEEPER_SERVERS_URL}}

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000


############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################

# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.
# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.
# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.
# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.

# The largest record batch size allowed by Kafka.
# If this is increased and there are consumers older than 0.10.2, the consumers' fetch size must also be increased so that the they can fetch record batches this large.
# In the latest message format version, records are always grouped into batches for efficiency.
# In previous message format versions, uncompressed records are not grouped into batches and this limit only applies to a single record in that case.
# This can be set per topic with the topic level max.message.bytes config.

# Increasing this value can increase the degree of I/O parallelism in the follower broker.

# The number of bytes of messages to attempt to fetch for each partition.
# This is not an absolute maximum, if the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch will still be returned to ensure that progress can be made.
# The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via message.max.bytes (broker config) or max.message.bytes (topic config).
replica.fetch.max.bytes={{ REPLICA_FETCH_MAX_BYTES }}

# The maximum allowed session timeout for registered consumers.
# Longer timeouts give consumers more time to process messages in between heartbeats at the cost of a longer time to detect failures.
